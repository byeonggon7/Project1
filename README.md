Website Link: https://byeonggon7.github.io/Project1/

Repository: https://https://github.com/byeonggon7/Project1

__Setup Process:__

Created a new GitHub repository

Developed the website using HTML & CSS.

Committed the HTML and CSS to the repository.

Configured GitHub Pages to publish the website from the repository.

__Challenges Faced:__

Initially, GitHub Pages took time to load after activation.

Faced minor issues with CSS formatting and file linking.

DNS propagation delays when testing accessibility.

__Networking Principles/Protocols Applied:__

Internet Protocol (IP): 185.199.108.153

HTTPS: https://yourusername.github.io/networking-project/

HTTPS is already enabled when creating a website from github

DNS: None

DNS is only required if a custom domain is used. Since the site is accessed using GitHubâ€™s subdomain (github.io), GitHub manages DNS automatically. No custom DNS records were configured.
