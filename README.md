Repository: https://https://github.com/byeonggon7/Project1

Setup Process

Created a new GitHub repository

Developed the website using HTML & CSS.

Committed the HTML and CSS to the repository.

Configured GitHub Pages to publish the website from the repository.

Challenges Faced

Initially, GitHub Pages took time to load after activation.

Faced minor issues with CSS formatting and file linking.

DNS propagation delays when testing accessibility.

Networking Principles/Protocols Applied

Internet Protocol (IP): 185.199.108.153

HTTPS: https://yourusername.github.io/networking-project/

HTTPS is already enabled when creating a website from github

DNS: None

DNS is only required if a custom domain is used. Since the site is accessed using GitHubâ€™s subdomain (github.io), GitHub manages DNS automatically. No custom DNS records were configured.
