# __Project Report__

### __Group 17__
### __Student Name:__ Andy Kim   
### __Website Link:__ https://byeonggon7.github.io/Project1/

## __Setup Process:__

### __A. Website Setup:__
1. Created my project folder (to house all project files).
2. Set up basic files: `index.html`, `styles.css` using __Notepad++__.
3. Used __Notepad++__ to create my CSS source file for basic website styling.

### __B. Choosing Hosting Service and Deployment:__
1. Used GitHub for hosting
2. In the repository setting, there is a build and deployment section.
3. Selected the branch to main and pressed save.
4. Deployed the site.

### __C. Implementing Networking and Security Aspects:__
- The __domain name server__ converts user-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses, enabling seamless website access without requiring users to remember IP addresses.
- __HTTP/HTTPS protocols__: facilitates standard web communication, while HTTPS enhances security by encrypting data using SSL certificates.
1. HTTPS is already enabled by default when setting up a page in Github.
2. DNS is not required since I am not using a custom domain.
3. Using nslook up https://byeonggon7.github.io/Project1/ in cmd, return the IP address: 185.199.109.153

## __D. Challenges__
1. Deployment errors during GitHub Pages setup, initially causing loading delays.
2. Minor CSS and file path issues when linking resources.
